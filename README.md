# MyJournal app helps keep track of progress and record of events and activities in an individuals life.
it literally substitutes the physical journal.
the user registers/ signs in using their gmail account which is the main authentication attribute.
in this app, the user is able to record notable events and their thoughts/feelings and which they can view online or offline
and be able to edit them even later on.
the app is not yet complete,but progress is being made to make certain notes sharerable, and some starred.
